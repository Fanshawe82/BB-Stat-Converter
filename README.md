# BB-Stat-Converter
A command line app that converts user-entered player data into advanced basketball metrics

Entering FG/FGA, 3PM/3PA, FT/FTA, and Turnovers will return TS%, eFG%, 3PAr, FTr, and TOV%

Includes input validation for all user entered data to ensure realistic values (i.e. free throws made cannot exceed  free throws attempted, three-pointers attempted cannot exceed total field goals attempted)
